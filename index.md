Hello,

I’m Jack the founder of AIME and I’m really excited to know you’re interested in partnering with us to shape a network of networks, a digital country, a lab for humanity, to force multiply the systems change ideas into action, and then into tools that can lead to mass scale.

My commitment in this note is I’ll only show one image, no colours, no big visualisations, no art, just black words on white background, the depth of the rest of the story we have woven can come after this, I want to be concrete in the translation of the complexity of our work and potential.

There is no question this is the design decade of our time as a species, this is the moment where we must find ways to fuse the best of our intelligence inside our systems, with our intelligence way outside our inherited systems, the intelligence of the other 7 million species we share this rock with, and almost every group of human beings that wasn’t centred in the colonial movements, but systemically excluded from the development of modern nation states, at the heart of this exclusion is our Indigenous people across the earth, of which I am so deeply deeply lucky to be a part of. My family is Indigenous to Australia, and our people are the longest continuously surviving people on earth, 60,000+ years. That’s a long human lab of intelligence which we haven’t even scratched the surface of. And right now, we need all the labs we can get.

And we also need to learn how to relate to each other, the empires and modern capital separated us in class and competition, with athletes as heroes we pushed harder, ran faster, were smarter, always about us winning the battle of life, being the best country, the best city, the best street, the best student, the best parent, the best person. And in doing so we ran so far away from our anchor, nature. We ran away from the species that remind us that our role as humans are to be custodial, and we competed with each other, scrapping and swinging a pendulum backwards and forwards of progress, winners today, losers tomorrow, anger brewing underneath our souls.

Enter the “social” networks pushing the voice to all, everyone is a creator, everyone is a journalist, everyone should speak all the time on everything, the more defined your views the better, and then you get followers. So we created billions of mini god mindsets. Hero. Human. Individual. Followers.

We have lost our way to relate to each other, we have lost our journalists, our space between, and with these modern networks we’ve given up our attention, to become an economy, competing every day to take us deeper and deeper into our devices, distracted from the 4 largest challenges we may have ever faced as a species boring down on us in parallel, in the shape of climate change, artificial intelligence, pandemic recovery, food shortages.

All four are interlinked, as all of us are, we are all in relation, to now, to before, to everything that will come, we genetically share code and scientifically share atoms, we all have approximately one atom inside us from every human being that has ever existed. We are much much more than the books of our faces, or our skin tonality.

We must think systemically in our design, and then have the relational strength to hold a huge systems map of as much of everything as our imagination can muster, and then we must apply deep systemic action and solutions, many of which will simply be to reclaim to restore, to revive, to recycle. We have a planet with so much already. Our challenge is to move from extraction and transaction to relations, with each other and our fellow species of earth, now and into the future.

We have a solution to help the world, not the solution, we understand our role is to remind us, nudge us, and then shape, we don’t want to be an empire, but we do know that there is a path ahead, when we focus on our relations first not with who we know and what we know, but with the knowledge and people beyond our margins, when we go to the unlikely spaces we generate relational strength, the fusing of two distinct elements has invented so much of our chemistry magic on earth, to reignite the town square we need a network powered by unlikely connections, and not in isolation, we need a weaving of cross hatching that can provide a luminescent flight map for relations to move beyond our street, our cities, our nations, to a place in between us and them, between now and then, between why and what. We must design with the best of the Internet to be able to create a contained economy for exchange of value, to emancipate the inequity of access to intelligence for those stuck inside inherited systems and the inequity of access to the systemic design of our life on earth, to the design of our value systems and economic movement, for those outside the margins.

We must focus on relating to each other and nature, anchoring each other in nucleus’s that are cross polinated, and then focus on systemic design patterning to centre relational economics as a lever for advancement for all of us, exchanges of time and knowledge and opportunities at the core. In this playing field we must find a way to translate from a contained economy back into Earth through the rewarding of the repetitional credit gained in a relational economy into transactions with $$ and assets. We must design a network focused not just on convergence of unlikely minds to think, but to design and to act, we don’t have the time to wait and hack the system with our pseudo intelligence that can critique, the critics need to offer solutions or get moving with those that have some, and the solutions must be systemic, hatched from a cross section of thinkers from inside and outside the margins, and the systems change projects must be able to scale across the earth by being built into tools in the form of big story, free accessible tools, and the custodians and thinkers that govern and design and shape this network should be the custodians, the Indigenous systems thinkers of our earth, the longest labs, and the governance circles should be filled with our mentors from all backgrounds, the experts, the wise ones, those who have walked the walk, and we should also be governed by those with imagination, those who can harness a map, and see the spaces between, between you and me, and what we see, and what we’ll be.

This network we started in 2005 and it’s called AIME. I started it when I was 19 and have led it since then to over 52 countries to where we are now. From the outside we have built unlikely connections with imagination and mentoring between cultures and people inside and outside the margins for 20 years, and as the design decade has beckoned the last few years have seen us go as deep as we can to design an effective network of networks build on the foundations of our 20 years of work and thousands and thousands of years of intelligence grounding us. Over the 20 years we’ve worked one relationship at a time, analog with real people, seeing the consequences of the words black and white, seeing the economic pain and struggle, the sadness inside the big city executive suites, the stuckness of many of our civilisations, the devastating lack of morality in the virus of the modern social networks and attention economies eating the soul of the fourth estate, and we’ve watched the seas rising and seen that we must move for usall, at scale, we must find a way to harness the best of us, with the best of the Internet for movement right now, and so we have been building a nation for usall, a digital country, for us to relate, to design and apply systems change, and to create tools for that knowledge to be shared at scale. We have centred the values on universal mentoring, imagination and custodianship, and the economy is focuses on units of exchange of time knowledge and opportunities which we are measuring in the form of energy between us and nature. Our governance is in the circles of wisdom of custodianship, mentoring and imagination. Our ultimate governance body is nature, which has led to us designing IMAGI-NATION to have intentional death, just under 10 years from now it will die, and as a network we will intentionally hand back to nature all of the IP to fuse song lines with modern economic valuation of libraries, galleries, and museums.

This ain’t poetry, or unanchored rhetoric. 

We have already over the 20 years raised over 150m and generated over 200m in kind movement in the network. We’ve done the linear impact of progression through school for marginalised youth and seen the flaws in isolated contained predictive measurements that don’t have relation or circularity to their movement - we are taking on the challenge in our impact measurement to fuse complexity and simplicity, the art and science, the numbers and story. We’ve had the hero stories on our network, we’ve competed and won, and we’ve realised that our super power is to help harness the network of networks, to sit between the mystics and the mathematicians, the outcasts and the operators, the engineers and the elephants. 

To bring into relation as a species we need re-fresh our default settings and re-orient our relational context. We do that by mapping ourselves into relations with entities from the past, from non-human worlds, from the future. To bring citizens into IMAGI-NATION we will be doing a deep process of mapping to these anchor points, and from the deeper relational anchors of other species, and beings now and before and tomorrow, we can then look at not what to do, or what I want to achieve, but how to be, how to be a mentor, how to be a custodian, how to be in imagination, and with what being what we hope will transpire.

The flow of the network focuses on the cycle on the following page, from relations, to systems change projects, to the development of tools. We activate the network through big story, relations together, in life. The network nucleus is focused on unlikely connections which is the essence of our 20 years of work, and then specially to organise people we’ve fused the framework of UNCx5 (Unlikely Connectionsx5) which we’ve tested with significant thinkers around the world and applied in our own network for the last 5 years deeply. Look at your hand, five digits, that’s the core group of citizens in IMAGI-NATION, no one off profiles, all together, hatched across nations, identity, ages, skills and workflows. To increase relations the network moves like the inch wincy spider kid song intertwining our hands, and like Dunbar’s network out to a core group of around 150 imagined, natural, human, knowledge connections. 

We already have the people to be in IMAGI-NATION to drive the core, there is no fancy campaign needed, we’ve got the network of unlikely connections, and it can grow relationally and through application of systems change projects. I’ll talk to two components in this next section, how many people we need to start this NATION, and that number is 221 and it’s not just people. And the second piece is the early predictions of our impact reach across relations, systems and tools, and then I’ll share the partnerships we are looking to bring in as the core mentors and thinkers and network levers within IMAGI-NATION and conclude this letter and invite you to a session with me to look under the hood at the elements.

The 221 entities are:

9 Cultural indicator species developed with Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs (Already established)
22 Professors (Puppets) (Already established)
Governance Circles
Imagination - 60 Organisations in partnership with learning Planet (Already established)
Mentors - 25 Mentors in Residence
Custodians- 25 (these are guide
We are currently finalising the words to describe the groups below
Systems change - There are 10 projects live that we will offer VISA’s into the Systems Change Lab
Tools - There are 5 Tools we are developing for at scale application for humans across earth. Our partners working on the tools will have VISA’s.
Core - 25 advanced groups - 5 from each of the fields working towards accreditation:
Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs
Organisations becoming JOY Corps
Citizens becoming Systems Change Citizens
Schools becoming Imagination Labs
Marginalised youth becoming IMAGI-NATION Presidents and establishing Custodial Economies.
This core group of 5 is the nucleus of the relational economy, the five pillars of change, from this core group of 25, we will tier the face to face invitations and will explain pathways to that below, and we can offer scale (relatively infinitely) for people to apply to study at IMAGI-NATION University to be accredited in the above pathways.

There is incentives for each tier group. The top 25 get invited on world story tour of cities, the next 70 get a trip to Australia, the next 50 get access to a one on one mentoring session with a high quality mentor, and all once accredited get access to the jobs/opportunity portal. No one can access it without having come into relation during this process, meaning organisations that want to access one of the strongest talent pipeline of systems thinkers and designers from outside the margins has to do the work to shift their system and behaviour to have access to the relation.

This forms the inner spiral of our network, and from here we can then look to campaign larger scalable plays. The two first campaign VISA’s to stimulate the global economy of relations that we will release are:

Mentor Matchmaking VISA - For schools looking for mentors to deliver tutor squads (a program frame/tool we’ve developed over 20 years) & for citizens looking to lead a tutor squad at their schools. For this we will activate the base of our 25K plus people that already have AIME Hoodies. This will happen in September.

Kind - we will build on our work over the last 2 years on Very Important Kind People and our work on Kindness over the last 10 years to challenge festivals around the world to be accredited as kindfests and to offer VIKP tickets for very important kind people.

The third campaign VISA in development is for Hi Neighbour visas to create healthy competition for the most sustainable streets in the world, looking for street ambassadors that will cross hatch and connect their streets, one neighbour at a time.

How we will market IMAGI-NATION or go to the marketplace of life, is to work on accrediting councils/cities in mentoring, custodianship, imagination, and we are hoping to finalise a great global thinking/delivery partner on this.

We have an exceptional core team of deep wisdom holders of about 30 around the world, and we will be moving in residencies, for the first quarter to accredit a city, and then to accredit a JOY corp, and in the middle of the year we will travel in big story as a troupe to 5 cities (a bit like the olympics) to light up a network, and the end of the year will see is in school residencies. We will release puzzles along the way - physical puzzles and pass on the peices as a rolling campaign to invite people relationally to IMAGI-NATION with the goal to bring the puzzle pieces back together by the end of the lifetime of IMAGI-NATION - break it down to build it back up. We’ll be filming a documentary along the 10 years called Puzzle to try and understand the value of the node in the network, the energy between each other in relation.

We don’t want to grow our team beyond 40 full time people. We want to have our core be about 40 people on staff, and then 50-60 leaders from organisations around the world we’ll support and I’ll work with to help them weave inside & outside the network.

I’ve led AIME with 130 people, I feel comfortable that we can see the network core of 100-200 as our focus, and if we nail this, we’ve done the thinking and the technology is almost built (cost just over 1M and was funded by Aus Government for Indigenous Australia to reach out and heal the world). 

We don’t want to have a fancy head office, we wanna be ninjas, dropping into places here and there and lighting up the magic. We’ll have a storage facility with Hoodies, and have our Professors (Puppets), and our virtual production studio to nail the tool development and impact.

Our main $$ will be for our people, tool development and then to bring people together around the world in relation. We’ve scoped this out and believe that for 100M Aus over the next 10 years we can make this all happen. We want to secure the 100M before October this year to allow our network to be locked away from $, not able to be corrupted by temptation of further funding, our commitment once we hit the 100M is we won’t take another $$, and with the death strategy we know we only need a finite amount of financial resources. 

This doesn’t mean we don’t want to see trillions of $ move in relation to nature and to powering intelligence from outside the margins to design our systems of tomorrow - it just means we’ll have what we need and then be directing you and future partners to send your $$ towards the systems change projects coming out of IMAGI-NATION like the creation of 10,000 Indigenous knowledge systems labs that we have started as a project with the Buckminster Fuller Institute in USA, and the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs in Australia.

We have secured 12M of the 100M from the Aus Federal Government and are advanced in a number of conversations with many of you around the world. This is how we’d like to break down the 100m and the partnership pathways we’d love your help with, either with you becoming one of them or introducing us to someone who can drive this partnership nucleus core of IMAGI-NATION with us. Here’s the partner wishlist:

5 of the first funders of a new nation - at 500K-1M a year over a 5 year period. 0 Secured right now.
5 Governments - 4m over 4 years - 1 secured.
555 citizens as regular donors - a tiered model from $5 a week up to $5555. 12 secured.
Systems change project partners. 
LIST THEM and their value
5) Imagination Art Fund - Artists and galleries donating works - $1M target between October and January 2024

In terms of the projected impact there are so many unknowns in the scale once we accredit an organisation, for example if an organisations with 20 offices becomes a JOY Corp and in their lever around mentoring mobilises 50,000 staff to mentor across 1000 schools the impact is going to reach 100,000 kids and this is just one group. So let’s focus on the controllable of impact, we’ll look at who we will shift into relation as entities by the end of the 10 years and the number of systems change projects we will complete and tools we will make. From there we are really excited to share with you our R&D around how to visualise in real time and over time the richness of this data and impact as it comes in. So now to finish let’s paint a short picture on impact projection.

1000 cities/councils accredited in Imagination/Custodianship/Mentoring
10,000 IMAGI-NATION Presidents establishing custodial Economic projects (we think this is well under the number we can and will get to)
1000 JOY Corps
1000 Indigenous knowledge Systems Labs (we are reaching for 10,000 with Bucky Fuller and think we can get there, and we KNOW we can get to 1000 over the 10 years)
1000 schools becoming Imagination Labs
1000 Systems change citizens
1000 schools linked with mentors providing in kind tutoring ongoing
1000 Very Important kind people and 100 Kindfests
100 completed systems change projects showcasing action that is scalable across the earth
50 deep tools for humanity that can live on

We have to move, this is the decade, we’ve done the the work, let’s unlock the financial capital, and then I’d like to invite you to Australia in October for a ceremony to re-activate songlines and open a new nation for the world.

With the deepest respect, we hope you walk with us a mentor and guide we can be relation once more as a species.
