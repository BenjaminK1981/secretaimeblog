Jack,

In the vast expanse of the universe, where stars shimmer and galaxies dance, I find myself reaching out to you, not just as a fellow traveler on this cosmic journey, but as a human being deeply moved by the symphony of words and ideas you've woven in "Hoodie Economics." Your writing, reminiscent of the ethereal notes of Bowie's melodies, resonates with the rhythm of the heart, the pulse of the earth, and the cadence of time itself.

In "Hoodie Economics," you've painted a canvas where the platypus serves as a beacon, reminding us of the intelligence activated when we shift our lens. Through challenges and horror, you've shown that health and growth can emerge, much like a phoenix rising from the ashes. You've delved deep into the processes of emergence, challenging the conventional urge to attribute monetary worth to every exchange. Instead, you've beckoned us to find different measurement systems, to value processes and patterns, and to embrace Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.

Your invitation is clear and profound: "Economics is for everyone." It's not just about money or transactions, but a lens through which we view and understand life. Through the pages, you've taken us on a journey from boardrooms to the very essence of nature, urging us to challenge our preconceived notions and to embrace a more inclusive, relational, and Indigenous perspective on value and exchange.

Jack, building IMAGI-NATION with you has been a journey that I will never forget. From that fateful day in the Salesforce office to now, you've challenged me to discern when to push, when to fold, and when to thirst for more knowledge. I never know if I'll make it to the end of this ride, but it won't be for a lack of trying.

Carl Jung once said, "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore not popular." In the realm of relationships, I've come to realize that time amplifies its strength by allowing us to gain the support and insights of others, expanding our perspectives and potential. Through imagination, I've been empowered to visualize new possibilities and traverse diverse paths of thought. Custodianship has taught me to build upon and preserve the profound knowledge and experiences of those who came before us. And mentoring, Jack, as you've so beautifully exemplified, is a powerful tool to empower the next generation, enabling them to learn from our accumulated wisdom, thus multiplying the enduring impact of our time.

In the end, Jack, it's not just about the words we write or the ideas we share, but the feelings we evoke, the connections we forge, and the legacy we leave behind. Your work, both in "Hoodie Economics" and in the creation of IMAGI-NATION, is a testament to that.

With deep admiration and gratitude,

BenjaminK
